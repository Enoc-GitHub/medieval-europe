1) If you don't have windows pro or enterprise, install docker toolbox https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/
2) Run Docker Quickstart Terminal
3) Note the ip address of the default machine that prints out in the terminal, something like 192.168.99.100
4) In the terminal run the following commands
    * docker pull gcr.io/me-test-server/server
    * docker images (note the image id of the me test server)
    * docker run -p 80:80 <image_id>
        - This can take several minutes as there are some php libraries that need to be downloaded
        - If you get any out of memory errors, stop the vm (docker-machine stop default)
          open VirtualBox, increase the amount of memory to the vm, then start the vm again
          (docker-machine start default).
5) Go to ip address from step 3 in your browser.
6) Email are disabled, so to create a user there's a bit of a process
    * Open another docker quickstart terminal
    * run docker container ls, note the container name
    * run docker exec -it <container_name> bash
    * run ls /var/www/medieval-europe/public_html/application/logs/
      there will be a log in the with the current date in the name, i.e. 2019-10-20.log.php
    * run tail -f /var/www/medieval-europe/public_html/application/logs/<date>.log.php
    * Go back to your browser and create a user
    * In the log information being printed out in the terminal there will be a section like the following
